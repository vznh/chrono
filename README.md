You can utilize **Chronolex** easily using natural language planning. You can also be as detailed or as broad as you'd like. **Chronolex** will never heavily assume anything. If you prefer, **Chronolex** will ask follow-up questions in order to make more educated calendar entries.  
For example, 

__Most ideal input__
```xml
<INPUT>
chaos theory mwf 8a to 9a at natural sciences 1 room 111 for 10 weeks
</INPUT>

<EXPECTED_OUTPUT>
<Event>
{
  name: "Chaos Theory",
  days: ["MON", "WED", "FRI"],
  location: "Natural Sciences 1",
  room: "111"
  recurring: {
    "freq": "weekly",
    "byday": ["MO", "WE", "FR"],
    "count": 30
  }
}
</Event>
</EXPECTED_OUTPUT>
```

__Least ideal and contextual input__
```xml
<INPUT>
chaos theory
</INPUT>

<EXPECTED_OUTPUT>
[Option to place as a to-do item instead of a calendar event]
[Optional] What time does it start and end? Where will it be located? Is this a recurring event? 
</EXPECTED_OUTPUT>
```

__Assumption of events__
```xml
<INPUT>
chaos theory natural sciences 1 
</INPUT>

<EXPECTED_OUTPUT>
<To-do>
{
  name: "Chaos Theory",
  location: "Natural Sciences 1"
}
</To-do>
</EXPECTED_OUTPUT>
```
